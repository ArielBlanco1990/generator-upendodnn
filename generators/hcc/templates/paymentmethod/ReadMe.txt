Hotcakes has several payment gateways ready and waiting for you to simply configure (in many cases with just your 
mouse).  Once you do, you can begin accepting payments using that gateway immediately.  That’s great, but what if 
you have a gateway that you need to support that is not in Hotcakes already?  What if you need to change the way an 
existing payment gateway works?  For example, you might need to support Authorize.Net Emulation.  This project will 
help you support that gateway in no time at all.
